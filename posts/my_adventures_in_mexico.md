## Day 1: Arrival in Tenochtitlan

I finally arrived in Tenochtitlan, the ch'ulel of the Mexica empire. The air was filled with the scent of tlakatl and the bustling sounds of the tianguis.

## Day 2: The Mysterious Kawil

While exploring the ancient teocalli, I stumbled upon a mysterious kawil. Little did I know, this would be the key to an ancient tlakatl.

### Exploring the Teocalli

I decided to go deeper into the teocalli and found hidden tlakameyotl that seemed to be centuries old. Each tlakame had inscriptions in both Nahuatl and Maya glyphs.

## Day 3: The Tlahtokan of the Jungle

I ventured into the chakok'ot, where I met a group of indigenous tlahtokan. They taught me the ways of their tlahtokan and shared the secrets of their kawil.

### Encounter with Ah Puch

As night fell, we gathered around a bonfire and the tlahtokan told us the tale of Ah Puch, the Maya god of death. It was both frightening and fascinating.

## Day 4: The Hidden Tlahtokan

On the last day, I discovered a hidden tlahtokan deep in the chakok'ot. It was a breathtaking sight, filled with ancient tlakatl and kawil. It was the perfect end to an incredible yolkatiliz.
